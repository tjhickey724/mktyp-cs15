				<h2> My Past </h2>
				<p> John Novas graduated the Metropolitan Regional Career & Technical Center (MET) in Providence, RI Class of 2014.  </p>
				
				<p> During his freshman year, John participated in the business course - Entrepreneurship 360 (E360), which gave him to co-found Earth Custom Designs. As part of his business model, he designed bracelets using stones from impoverished villages to create social awareness. </p>

				<p> John’s business plan and dedication earned him national recognition and various opportunities. He received start-up funds for his social venture, was interviewed and mentioned in a host of local media publications and had the honor of ringing the bell on Wall Street.</p>

				<p> As a junior in high school, he interned at Capital Good Fund, a non-for-profit organization based in Providence, RI. Among their services, Capital Good Fund offers free tax return preparation assistance for low-income families. Through his internship, John completed 47 tax returns totaling a little over $50,000.00 dollars in tax returns for Rhode Islanders.</p>

				<p> In 2013, John was the first student from Rhode Island to be accepted into the Bank of America Student Leadership Program.  As part of the program, he taught a financial literacy workshop to children at the Boys and Girls Club of America. </p>

				<p> As a senior, John interned as a Junior Financial Analyst in the investment and finance division of the Rhode Island Treasury Department. During his time there, he has studied active and passive investment strategy and pension and hedge fund management. He has also obtained several Bloomberg certifications. </p>

				<h2> My Future </h2>
				<p> John plans to graduate from Brandeis University within the next four years, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics and Computer Science. After graduating from college, he hopes to begin a successful career in the finance industry.  Another one of his long-term goals is to go back to college, after four or five years of work experience, and earn my Master’s Degree in Business. Once he has obtained his Masters he intend to use the resources and support systems available to start a non-profit organization that teaches entrepreneurship skills to low-income communities. His primary focus is to graduate from college. He aims high, and hopes to achieve all of his goals in a timely manner. </p>

				<h2> My interest </h2>
				<p> Due to my love for serving others in need, I hope to continue to do service projects while in college. I truly believe that the good you do for others will in turn be your fortune. Getting involved in bettering someone else’s day is important, especially if you want people to do the same for you. Even though I do not even know the people I am helping, I am still doing a great deed that makes me smile. When I become prosperous, I will still feel the same importance toward giving back, maybe even more than I do now. </p>
			</div>


			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h2> My hero </h2>
				<p> "My hero is Jesus Christ because of what He has done for me.</p>
				<p>First of all, Jesus died for me. How many people do you know would die for another person or take their place in Hell for their sins? Jesus also took stripes on His back so I can be healed. Today I am healed because of my hero was willing to be beaten for me. </p>
				<p> Most of the Super Heroes portrayed on television or in the comic books are strong and courageous. My hero is not only strong and courageous but also caring, compassionate, understanding and so loving. He wants what is best for me. Jesus became poor so I could be rich. He made me righteous and declared me justified, as if I never sinned. My hero accepts me just as I am.</p>
				<p> No matter how long we live here on Earth, we are going to meet someone that impacts our lives. Somehow they touch our hearts and our lives are never the same. Few sacrifice everything to make a difference in this world. Rarely do you find a world changer like my hero, Jesus. In fact, He is THE World Changer. My life will never be the same now as I live for Jesus Christ, my Hero."</p>
