			  	<h1> My Past </h1>
			  	<p>
			  		I was born on August 25, 1996. People usually find me to be quiet, but it's not because i'm anti-social. I was taught to think before I speak and if what I am thinking isn't worthy of coming out of my mouth, I don't respond.  I moved out of my mother's house at the age of 11. At that time, I moved in with my two sister (Martina and Ceresa) and my four unbelievablly handsome nephews. We moved a lot throughout the years. I have never been at a school longer than 2 years. It was very hard for me surviving school. I was never the smartest in the room or the prettiest. It wasn't until high school that I actually started to make real friends and realize the people that didn't have the best interest for me. Throughout the struggles and problems, It gave me the strength I have today and i'm not embarrased to talk about my past because I know that one day I will be able to realte to others and help them. Below are pictures of (starting from the left) My Talentented and Beautiful Mother, My Amazing Sister Ceresa who took care of me, My Bestfriend/Sister Martina, and my Wonderful Nephews, and my Inspiring Aunt Ramila.

			  	<h1> My Future >> </h1>
			  	<p> 
					I have always seen myself having my own family and raising my own children. I do want to become a Physical Therapists for the Bulls or a Football team. I want to be able to support my family. One Day, i'll start my own organization that helps girls all over the U.S. realize their true beauty on the inside and out.

			  	<h1> My Inspirations</h1>
			  	<p>
			  		I have always looked up to my mother as far as talent, creativity, and her generousity. My Aunt Ramila has always been there for me emotionally. I can literally tell her anything and she doesn't judge me. My sister Ceresa is probably the strongest woman I have ever known. Ceresa took me and my sister Martina in when I was 11 years old plus she already had four chilren of her own. Living with Ceresa wasn't always easy but I know that I ended up better than most. Lastly, My Mentor, Cynthia, has helped me so much. I didn't think I would have been in college if it wasn't for her. She has shown me so many things and life and has given me the tools that many people doen't have. Without these people I wouldn't be the young woman I am today.

			  	<h1> Interest/Hobbies </h1>
			  	<p>
			  		I have always had a huge fascination with music and art. On my spare time, I read Fan Fiction and Afro-American Novels. I have also been a huge fan of Chris Brown since his "Run IT" Video. Although I do enjoy movies, I love spending quality time with my friends and family. Often times technology gets in the way of this. I do hair, makeup, and eyebrows. I love making other people feel better about themselves and supporting them with their dreams.
