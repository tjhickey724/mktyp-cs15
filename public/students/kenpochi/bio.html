					<h2>My Past</h2>
					<p>Imagine being in a state where you can't trust anyone, not even your own family. Imagine that the only food you have around is a small bowl of rice and soy sauce and you've been eating this every other day and that on those other days, you aren't eating because there's nothing else to eat. Imagine you had a little sister who needed to eat and you gave her your food whenever you could because you don't want her to feel hungry even when you always are. Imagine living a life where no one could see or understand the issues that you have. Imagine not being able to tell anyone your situtation because you either thought it was regular or you just had felt like it was something that shouldn't be shared. Imagine understanding that everyone living outside of your family is different. Imagine understanding that your different and that the others are not. Now, imagine living the rest of your life accepting. That's the life I came from. That's my home and before, it was all I had.

					<h2>My Present</h2>
					<p>I am a student at Brandeis and I am proud to say that life has changed for me, for the better. I discovered the reasons that caused my family to be in the posistion that it's in. Through all of the fustration and mistrust, I've come to forgive all that has happened to me. It wasn't my fault, it wasn't their fault. Bad things happen and sometimes there's no good decisions or choices to take. Today, I have reached a point where I can say that I have a family. I my still not have a home, but I have a family. People who I trust and want to support. I also have an opprotunity to have a successful career. This means no more days surviving on rice and soy sauce and probably even a chance at living and being alive, to be happy. I have a chance at living a legacy.

					<p>Honestly, I never looked up to anyone or even had any role models. I guess the only hero I see, is the hero I want to become for the people I love around me.
