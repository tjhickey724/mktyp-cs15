					Michelle's Bio Page <br/> Spring 2015
				</h1>
				<p>
					Hi! My name is Michelle and I am 20 years old. I attend the Myra Kraft Transitional Year Program at Brandeis University. I am learning how to do some computer programming and it is way harder than people make it seem.

				    <h2>My Past</h2>
				   <p>
					   My past has formed me into the person that I am today but it doesn't mean that it't the only thing that identifies me.

			    <div class="col-md-4">
				    <h2>My Present</h2>
 				   <p>
 					   I want to live in this moment and not worry of the things that are of little importance in my life. College and success is where my mindset is at!

				    <h2>My Hereos</h2>
 				   <p>
 					   My biggest hero is my mother because she showed me and made me see the world in a different perspective. Without my mother and her influences and her dedication I wouldn't be who I am today. I also admire a man that helped me throughout my life. Danny Nunez took my heart and made me realize that dreaming big wasn't a waste of time. I never knew you could love someone as much as we loved each other. My elementary school nurse, Nurse Cathy is also someone I admire because of her dedication to me she was like my second mother.
