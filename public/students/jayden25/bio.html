					<p>
						"It started from a dream I make real looks fake. I am never wrong for the things that I say but only for the things that I conform to that others may not understand"

					<h1>My Future</h1>
					<p>Its never about how hard you get knocked down but how when you get knocked down you keep fighting you keep pushing. I see myself as a successful Contract Lawyer, Who knows maybe follow my path in to the N.F.L., become a succesful father, have my own house built from the ground up,and givng my mother the life she always wished for. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h1>My Interests</h1>
					<p>To become everything that others wanted to do but never had the will to. Always believing iin the grind and the hustle that got me to this point. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-3">
					<h1>My Heroes</h1>
					<p>I have many I look at every individual as an inspiration. My mother starts the beginning the many days and nights up at the kitchen table. Making me read and recite definitions to her, but telling me that the life you choose is your  life noot hers. My dad even became my inspiration as many mistakes he have made I promise to not follow that same trail. My older brothers cause he start to believe in me when I started to lose faith in myself. My twin brothers cause I look at them and see the guy who I am becoming. God cause the pain and hurt he indured gives me an opportunity to accomplish anything.</p>
