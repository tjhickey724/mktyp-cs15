					Joey's Bio Page <br/> Spring 2015
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am my own legend. I may not be widely known, or even thought of, but I am a legend in my own right. We all are. I am the first male in my family to graduate high school and make it to college. I am also a musician. I taught myself how to play piano, guitar and the ocarina (like the one from The Legend of Zelda games). I took martial arts for 3-4 years at Revolution Martial Fitness in Natick, Massachusets before coming to college and I think I will continue later in the future after I graduate college and find a well-paying job. The styles that I learned were Gracie Jiu Jitsu, Kempo, Kung Fu/Wushu, and Muay Thai. That is just a little bit about me. My name is Joseph Figueroa and I am my own legend.

						<h2>My Past</h2>
						<p>My past has was an interesting time to go through. In the past, I learned things no child/young teen should have to learn at that age. What I'm talking about is helping to take care of two children at the age of 13 to 15 while about to start high school. I had to help take care of my two little cousins, one being 7 months when we first got him and the other being 1 1/3 years old. It was not fun </p>

						<h2>My Present</h2>
						<p>My Present on the other hand is so much better and I couldn't ask for anything else. People say that it can take a lifetime to find the special "one". I am happy to say that I found her in my junior year of high school and we are still going strong to this day. No fights between us, we talk about everything, the comfort level is at a high, and we both love each other. We make two years in March and I couldn't be happier.</p>
