					Joey's Bio Page <br/> Spring 2015
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am my own legend. I may not be widely known, or even thought of, but I am a legend in my own right. We all are. I am the first male in my family to graduate high school and make it to college. I am also a musician. I taught myself how to play piano, guitar and the ocarina (like the one from The Legend of Zelda games). I took martial arts for 3-4 years at Revolution Martial Fitness in Natick, Massachusets before coming to college and I think I will continue later in the future after I graduate college and find a well-paying job. The styles that I learned were Gracie Jiu Jitsu, Kempo, Kung Fu/Wushu, and Muay Thai. That is just a little bit about me. My name is Joseph Figueroa and I am my own legend.

						<h2>My Past</h2>
						<p>My past has was an interesting time to go through. In the past, I learned things no child/young teen should have to learn at that age. What I'm talking about is helping to take care of two children at the age of 13 to 15 while about to start high school. I had to help take care of my two little cousins, one being 7 months when we first got him and the other being 1 1/3 years old. It was not always fun </p>

						<h2>My Present</h2>
						<p>My Present on the other hand is so much better and I couldn't ask for anything else. People say that it can take a lifetime to find the special "one". I am happy to say that I found her in my junior year of high school and we are still going strong to this day. No fights between us, we talk about everything, the comfort level is at a high, and we both love each other. We make two years in March of 2015 and I couldn't be happier.</p>

						<h2>My Future</h2>
						<p> For my future, although not completely sure what I want yet, I know that I want to graduate college and find a career so that I can support my family and be able to start my own family and take care of them as well.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h2>My Interest</h2>
						<p>I am interested in music and video games and many more things. I enjoy playing music and listening to music. I have always been musically talented. I always taught myself how to play the instruments I know. I know how to play guitar, piano, ocarina and I used to know how to play the flute but I forgot how to read sheet music. For the guitar, piano and ocarina, I can play at a decent beginners level but with practice, maybe one day I can be as good as slash in from Guns and Roses.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h2>My Heros</h2>
						<p>My personal heroes would be my mom, sister and brother. My father has been in and out of my life so even though I love him because he is my father, he hasn't been that much of a role model in my life. The reason these people are my heroes is because these people have helped me grow as not only a man but a person. My brother has been my main male role model and helped me grow as a man and taught me to be a better man. My mother and sister have taught me how to treat women and also how to be a better man. I am grateful for them all. As for my physical hero, Bruce Lee would be my hero in terms of physicality. Bruce Lee has been my role model for what I wanted to be able to physically do since I was little. Because of watching his movies and looking at his history, I joined the martial arts and worked hard to be even within 5% of how he was. I got to that 5% but I still need to work on it.</p>
