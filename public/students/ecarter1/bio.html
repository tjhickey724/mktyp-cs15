			  	<h1> *My Past* </h1>
			  	<p>
			  		Born on June 14th, 1996 around 2 p.m., I made my way into the world at Women and Infants Hospital of Providence Rhode Island. At the age of four, my mom, my siblings and I moved to Mount Airy, North Carolina in an effort to reunite with family and find a better job opportunity for my mother. I lived in North Carolina up until July of 2007 when my family and I moved back to Central Falls, Rhode Island. I attended school from fifth to twelth grade in Central Falls and Pawtucket, RI. I graduated from Blackstone Academy Charter School in June of 2014. Throughout high school, I played varsity Volleyball, Basketball, and Softball.

			  		I always imagined myself being a lawyer but after doing my internship at a court house my junnior year of high school, I came to the realization that law was where I was headed but being a lawyer was no longer in my interest. In some years from now, I plan to join the police force as I make my way towards becoming a homicide detective. I also plan to fit a family of my own into my busy life at some point. Another main goal is creating recreation centers in my hometown in an effort to open up opportunities for youth who are stugglling to stay off of the streets.

			  	<h1> *My Heroes* </h1>

			  	<p>
			  		While there are many heroes in this world, there are a select few people who are my heroes. My heroes are all of the faculty and staff in my high school for pushing me throughout high school and opening up multiple opportunities for myself anff my family. They were truly my friends who not once gave up on me. Second is my mother who has done everything and more for my family and I. She is the definiton of strong and independent. Although we never had a great relationship, we have grown as mother and daughter as I left to college. Lastly, is Hip-Hop icon Tupac Shakur! He is an amazing artist and has helped me to realize that anyone can be a rose growing from the concrete.
