				</h1>
				<p>
					I was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. My parents are Wilfredo Nunez and Laura Ruiz; my father was born in Puerto Rico and my mother was born in The Dominican Republic. I am one of six siblings, I have three older ones and two younger. My favorite sport is Boxing/Cage Fighting and my favorite athlete is Anderson Silva. I do not know what I want to major in just yet, but computer science is grabbing at my attention.

					<h2>My Past</h2>
					<p> I grew up in the capital of Rhode Island a weird place called Providence. I had to repeat the 2nd grade but avenged my self first year of middle school by attending the Urban Collaborative Acceleration Program. Which allowed me to complete three years of middle school in only two. I never experienced freshman year because I went straight to tenth grade my first year of highschool. I was challenged and faced many difficulities but thank God I graduated from The Juanita Sanchez Educational Complex in 2014.

					<h2>My Present</h2>
					<p> I am 18 years old and a first-year MKTYP student at Brandeis University. The toughest thing about higher education is having to sometimes be so far away from the ones you love. But the benefit of that is the discovering such a brand new world outside of our natural boxes. New friends, new connections and new memories. So far my courses have been challenging and tougher than any of my high school classes; but I do love a challenge because it helps me expand my mental barriers.

					<h2>My Interest</h2>
					<p> I am currently Undeclared but Computer Science is grabbing my attention in 2015.I enjoy the ability of being able to create, add and replace mostly anything in the virtual world.Also, I am currently part of an improv group named "Crowd Control" which allows me to perform with a great group of people in front of great Brandeisians. In addition, I was boxing back at home so now I spend some time in the gym here on campus continuing my training. I do like to keep my self pretty busy.
