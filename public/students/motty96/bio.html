					<h2>My Past</h2>
					<p> 
						I was born on November 21st, 1996 in Nigeria. I have two siblings and I am the middle child of my parents. When I was 13 years, my family and I decided to move to the United States Of America. Moving to the United States was very hard for me because I had to leave my friends behind and move to ne w country. My parents decided to settle in Brockton, MA where I went to Brockton High School and made lots of new friends.
